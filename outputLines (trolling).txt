426555: I can't believe you didn't choose, Ugh, let's move on
426560: Ooh, tough break little meeple
426561: At least everyone else is happy, right?
426562: Sorry you had to pay out like that little one
426563: Oh what a shame for only you, and no one else
426564: And since that's no one, the points are all yours
426565: And since there's no one else, you get all the points
426566: But there's no one nearby so you get all the points
426567: Which means it is time for, the last spin of the round
426568: Which can only mean its time for the last spin of the round
426569: So its time for one last high stakes spin
426570: And so we've come to this last spin of the round
426571: Oof, all this spinning filled up my troll meter
426572: Your spins have filled up my troll meter
426573: huh, that troll meter above me is filled now
426585: Its time for a crazy point swing and I'm excited
426586: Who has a swappable score, you tell me
426587: It's like Freaky Friday, but it's with points instead of learning important life lessons
426588: Who needs to swap? The choice is yours
426589: Ugh, These Skull Slices are all over me now
426590: (ignore)
426591: (ignore)
426606: You, and everyone touching this slice is a winner
426607: You and your neighbors split the pot, how sweet
426608: How about points for you, and the slice adjacent
426609: I see happy meeples coming after this spin
426610: A you, and the slice neighbors all gonna get a piece of pie
426611: You, and the slice neighbors share the pot
426612: You, and the slice neighbors each get a share of the pot
426613: I'm being overtaken by skull slices, what a dilemma
426614: Ugh, these skull slices are all over me now
426616: There was a movie in 2000 called skulls that had nothing to do with the skulls on my face
426617: Its skull city over here
426618: Choose any slice and it'll duplicate atop the slices next to it
426619: Choose a slice and watch it duplicate on top of the slices next to it
426620: Choose any slice to make it duplicate on top of nearby slices
426621: Okay, let's make a few more slices
426622: I read you loud and clear
426623: Let's see how brainy your choice was
426624: Alright, if that's the slice you want
426625: Here come some duplicated slices
426634: And I'm excited because you're going first
426636: and the spinning process begins with you
426637: and who would have guessed? You spin first
426638: and I've decided that YOU will go first
426653: Oh No
426654: Aw, That's a bummer, right?
426655: Ow, You deserve better
426656: Aw little meeples, no
426657: Uh, not like that
426658: Aw, I don't believe it
426659: Aw that's no fun
426660: Aw, I hate it when that happens
426682: No one else is around, aren't you lucky
426683: No other players to share with, what a lucky meeple
426684: Nobody to share with? What a fun day for you
426685: Selfishly splitting the pot with no one, I love it
426692: A swap there shall be
426693: A decision, has been made
426694: And so it is decided
426695: Whatever you say little one
426696: Well chosen, my little friend
427017: Ga-Ugh w-what did I tell you? It's like a Cinderella-midnight thing with these slices
427018: You couldn't decide? Now I have to move on
427019: But why? Okay, forget the slice surplus, Let's just continue the game
427020: How very indecisive of you, Let's move forward, shall we?
427382: Time's running out, Your decision has to be unanimous
427383: Hurry up, If you can't decide on the same person, then so be it
427384: Your voting time is almost done
427386: Let's see what you all picked
427387: Let's see if anyone caught you
427388: So, where did everyone choose?
427389: Let's see those decisions
427391: Spin as many times as you can, I have points for everyone
427392: Spin me again and again, I have points to give
427393: Ugh, Spin me over and over, I bear the gift of the points
427394: Spin me as many times as you can, I'm flush with points
427395: Spin me as many times as you can, I'm bursting with points
427397: Aw, you didn't pick a slice, You know what, I'm gonna give everyone else the pot, You're welcome
427398: You didn't even pick a slice, Everyone else will be rewarded for your indecisiveness
427399: Why didn't you pick? Now I have to give everyone else the points
427400: The points you take are fixed, so everyone there will chip in equally
427401: The points you steal are fixed, so anyone there will chip in equally
427403: Okay, okay, I can compose myself, Let's move on
427404: Wow, that was just a lot, Let's pretend that never happened
427406: Okay then, ,Let's just continue at a more mild pace
427407: Oh come on, This is a good chance to target someone specific-like
427408: Hurry okay? You don't want to waste this opportunity
427409: You're running low on seconds to steal
427411: You're gonna pick a slice and so will everyone else
427412: You and the others are gonna pick a slice
427413: You're gonna pick a slice, as will the others
427415: Well you found a slice all to yourself, Enjoy the pot
427416: You win the challenge, The others couldn't handle your heat
427417: You found a slice all your own, The pot is yours now
427418: You win the challenge, Everyone else is jealous, I can tell
427419: What a dastardly move, stealing all those points
427420: It's almost like those points were meant to be stolen
427421: Ah, you really stole those points good
427422: You stole those points with all the stealth of a cat burglar, Meow
427423: Those points are all yours now, like the end of Ocean's 11 through 13
427425: Looks like a decision has been made, Sorry, Slice Owner
427426: They chose someone else, Oh, they must really not like you, Slice Owner
427427: Everyone else says they prefer this other meeple, And so it is
427429: Look at that
427430: Oh I'm so happy
427431: Cowbunga, like a turtle
427432: I'm so pleased
427433: Hey
427434: That's what I'm talking about
427435: Oh that is fun
427436: What a good thing for you
427437: What do you know about that
427438: How about that
427439: Pick a slice and you'll steal points from anyone who's on it
427440: Pick a slice and you'll steal points from everyone there
427446: I can't stand that you didn't steal, what is this world coming to?
427447: You forgot to steal, Why do we even bother
427448: You didn't choose and I'm very disappointed, Let's continue
427450: I like that
427451: Rotation
427452: I'm a wheel
427453: ROAR
427454: Ho ho
427455: Look at me
427456: YES
427457: Of course
427463: You win the pot because the others couldn't find common ground
427464: You win the pot because of some disagreeable meeples
427465: The others couldn't coalesce, That means you get the good stuff
427467: Well, okay
427468: Alright, not bad
427469: Well, that's something
427470: Okay, why not?
427471: There you go

427491: Hey, they got you, you know what? I'm going to give them the pot instead
427492: You got caught, I'm think they should split the pot instead
427493: They found you, And just like that I've decided to give them the pot instead
427498: Uh, its like i'm on a sugar rush or something
427499: Huh I feel limber like a lynx or some other mountain dwelling cat
427500: The energy of that slice is coursing through me with vigor
427501: Ooh, I'm all jacked up on this Power Slice, Ho-ho, baby

444680: I gotta reward your genius with two slices
444681: Not one but TWO slices
444682: A pair of sweet, sweet slices
444683: These slices are pointy on one end, and they're yours
444684: It's a like an abundance of slices 'cause there's two
444685: Twice the slices
444686: Two slices for being SO smart
444687: My father gave me these two slices and now I'm giving them to you
444688: Both of you did so good
444689: Both of you did so good
444690: You both did the same and it makes me happy
444691: A two-way tie for you two
444692: Look at you two
444693: Two tiny titans of trivia
444694: You both deserve equal adulation
444695: I'm seeing double with these duplicate scores
444696: Your scores are the same, What a treat
444697: You've travelled so far to play the world's best trivia game
444698: But watch out, you split the points if you share a slot
444699: But watch out, you split the points if you share a slot
444700: Just be careful, you split the points if you share a slot
444701: But know this, you split the points if you share a slot
444702: You did the same, I gotta give you both a slice
444703: You did the same? I gotta give you both a slice
444704: A tie? I guess you both deserve one slice then
444705: Look at this, I'm giving you both a slice
444706: There's a slice for the two of you 'cause you have the same score
444707: You both did so good I have a slice for each of you
444708: It's a tie so you both get one of my precious slices
444709: You should probably pick a slice that your opponent is on
444710: You should probably pick a slice that your opponent is on
444711: Consider stealing points from your opponent, yeah?
444712: There's a lot of cool stuff you can do with this, so choose wisely
444713: This is a slice for the strategic players, I just hope that's you
444714: Hurry okay? You don't want to waste this opportunity
444715: You're running low on seconds to steal
446007: One more question outta do it
446008: One more question outta do it
446009: So I'm only going to ask you ONE question this round
446010: So I'm only going to ask you ONE question this round
446011: This game is running longer than anticipated
446012: This game is running longer than anticipated
446013: Like they drive a food truck that only sells organic root vegetables, or something? That’d be fun
446014: And then we watch a reality show about their crazy hijinks
446015: That would show both your parents how independent you are, Call me after the game, we’ll talk
446016: I'll get the ball rolling with some buzz words: Ice cream, Hang gliding, Damn, I'm good
446017: I’m watching you
446018: Nyeh… It’s probably my imagination
446019: What if THESE TWO started a business together
446021: What if these two just quit the game altogether and decided to live off the land here on my mountain top? That would be, ,I-I mean, sadly there’s no vegetation up here
446022: And who could forget about the Power Slice
446025: Oh, one sek, Vin Diesel's texting me, If I don't respond right away, he gets like, ha, you know
446026: Have you ever wondered why I ask you trivia questions instead of making you joust while riding tigers? Because I sure have
446027: Hey, what’s with all the awesome clouds in this game? Oh, thanks for asking, I’m so glad someone appreciates all of the crafty set pieces I set up for you, weeks in advance
446028: Hey Wheel, what are your hobbies? Glad you asked, In my spare time I like to squish people, I just kind of fall from the sky and land on them, and they squish, It's fun
446029: There are so many things to tap right now I couldn't even find them on your device without scrolling, Ugh, Ga, What the heck was I thinking?
446030: Sometimes I take a bubble bath in a volcano, It's great for the skin, You should try it sometime
446031: Nobody talks about how great lamps are anymore, They make things bright, They turn ON, with a SWITCH, What is not to love?
446032: It gets lonely on this mountain sometimes, But, I'm just glad you're here, Buried in your phones, totally ignoring me
446033: Remember when they first invented paper? Man, That was a big day
446034: Remember when they built the first pyramid? I told Egypt it was a bit much, but, what do I know about being big and ostentatious?
446035: oooohh oooohh oooohh oooohh oooohh, Da da da da daaaah, Oh gosh, I thought I was on mute, Uh that's embarrassing
446036: All this tapping reminds me how much I love to tap dance, But it makes me sad cause I’ll never do it myself, Don’t think about that - just keep tapping
446038: Quickly choosing between two things? What kind of sadist would make you do that
446039: As each player struggles to choose between two things, we can all agree… at least you're not doing Math, Hey hey, Tip your bartenders
446040: If you can’t decide which one to pick, go with the one with more letters, That works like 50% of the time
446041: I know you’re busy right now, but I just want to remind everyone how neat dolphins are, They’re always smiling
446042: When you tap the right answer and it makes that little ding sound, that's actually me making that noise, I have a little device next to me that I press and it goes ding, Super nifty
446043: Aw, meeple what happened to you? You've got a lot of ground to make up
446044: Hey, it’s possible to come back from the dead, It’s extremely rare, but yeah, I’ve seen it happen
446045: My friend, I have two words for you… TRY and HARDER
446046: What can I say to you but… thanks for joining us
446047: Hey buddy, You doing ok?
446049: I’m expecting a Cinderella story from you, In a friends with a lot of rats sort of way
446050: The slices shall be distributed as follows
446051: The slices shall be distributed as follows
446052: Another round? That's a lot of spinning and not a lot of winning
446053: Another round? That's a lot of spinnin' and not a lot of winnin'
446054: You all look like little Lucky Charms marshmallows, Has anyone ever told you that?
446055: You know I just noticed something that we have in common, Neither one of us… have feet, Isn’t that fun?
446056: Careful of the hundreds of cliffs around here - I know you all are particularly squishy
446057: So, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but uh, what’s with the fingers? Can I have one, or
446058: There used to be a lot of yetis that lived on this mountain, They'd just find things smaller than them and beat 'em up for no reason at all, Oh, Yetis, what're you gonna do?
446059: Some Canadian's just told me I look just like one of their Toonies, Ugh, Canadians
446060: Every time I give you two slices someone in the world is sent back in time, I'm talking about the Cretaceous period over here
446061: I'm writing a screenplay about a guy who can't stop giving people two slices, It's called, Shut up, here are some slices, What do you think?
446062: Can you believe I used to just answer people’s questions for money? Pretty silly, This Q and A thing makes a lot more sense, 
446064: If you think this is hard you should have played 100 years ago, I used to spit large fruit at you while you sing, Ha, Yeah, not a fan favorite
446065: Tons of things go together, Me and intelligence, me and stupendousness, me and beauteousness
446066: If you can’t match anything up, remember, you can always just be wrong
446067: Matching things sure is hard, I can't even remember who asked me what at the beginning of the game, You wanted to know something about aardvarks, right?
446068: When I finally retire I think I'll turn myself into a crab and live under the sea, I'm all about that crustacean life
446069: It is heartwarming how many things in this world match, Other dimensions don't have anything that match
446070: So, there's a specific combination, where if you try to match it, you explode, Try to figure out which one it is
447263: That slot with arrows? It gives you points if you're next to it
447264: That slot with arrows gives points to you if you're next to it
447265: That's A LOT of points
447266: That's A LOT of points
447267: So many freakin' points
447268: What a huge payout
447269: You hit the jackpot
447270: That's a big number over your head
447271: Wha-how many points did I just give you?
447272: So many points from just one spin
447273: If you all crowd around it, the pot will be spread thin
447274: But if too many take part, the prize will be spread thin
447558: Slowing down, oh, oh, oh?
447559: I'm slowly reducing in speed, 
447561: Will I, get there? uhhhh
447562: I'm not dizzy, I promise you
447563: I'm almost stopped, now, uhh
447564: Oh, oh, I, don't
447565: This is going to be good, I just know it
447566: Oh boy, This, could be
447567: Gradually slowing down, and?
447568: The mystery of where I land is about to
447569: Here it comes, and
447604: You heard me, Even you players can weigh in
447605: That means even you players can vote, Democracy
447606: Oh, everyone means players can vote too
447607: If the majority of you pick the best player, you'll earn some special slices of your own
447608: If the majority of you choose the best player, you'll earn some special slices of your own
447609: This game is going long
447611: Do you want players next to a Power Slice to get points or lose points?
447612: Do you want players who are next to a Power Slice to get points or lose points?
447613: Vote for the player that you think will do the best
447614: Yeah yeah, The moyai picks up some slices
447615: M, Nom nom, The moyai wins some slices
447616: Well that's a fine slice-earning choice there moyai
447617: moyai, You get two slices for that
447618: Smooth pick moyai, Time for some slices
447619: The moyai picked a winner, Slice time
447620: And hey, If you're the moyai
447621: And what about you, the moyai
447622: Do you want players next to a Skull Slice to get points or lose points?
447623: Do you want players who are next to a Skull Slice to get points or lose points?
447624: We're still going? How is that possible?
447625: Ugh, this game is running so long my spokes are rusting
447626: Holding out for just a few more votes
447627: Voting time is just, about
447628: Waiting for any late votes
447629: Aw, swing and a miss, moyai
447630: m, you'll choose better next time moyai
447631: and what did you decide
447632: Let's see where the votes landed
447633: Ooooh, I can't wait to see what you all said
447634: I wanna know what you picked
447635: Let's see what'cha said
447637: Talk out loud, See if you can all agree on something together
447638: Now's the time to talk out loud and beg the moyai to vote in your favor
447639: Try to convince the moyai to vote with you, They are fickle but I know how persuasive you can be
447640: One of these two things is better for you, am I right?
447641: It's time to campaign out loud, Convince people to vote in your best interest, ya know?
447642: Talk out loud and make your case, I know one of these options is better for you in the long run
447643: So there will be only ONE question this round
447644: So I'm asking you ONE question this round and that's it
447645: Everyone gets to vote now
447646: Everyone can vote on their device
447647: Tough break moyai
447648: Oh, The moyai backs the wrong horse
447649: The moyai chose, poorly
447650: Nice try moyai
447651: The moyai didn't see that comin'
447652: I don't know what the moyai was thinking
447653: One more question should be enough
447654: One more round should do the trick
447655: You won that pot, but now it's time for the moyai to chime in
447656: You won the pot, but now the moyai is gonna go ham
447657: You won the pot, but let's see what the moyai does, 
447658: And who could forget about the Power Slice
447659: And then there's the Power Slice
447660: And we must not neglect the Power Slice
447661: And we're not going anywhere till I hand out the Power Slice
447662: You want power slices or more troll slices
447663: Do you want to add more Power Slices or more Troll Slices?
447667: moyai, You chose the right player, Have some slices
447668: The moyai voted so good, Here's some slices
447669: Do you want my troll meter to be full or reset?
447670: Do you want the troll meter to fill up, or do you want me to reset it
447671: Let's do the opposite cause why not
447672: Forget that, I'm doing this instead
447673: That's exactly the opposite of what I wanted, so
447674: Okay, let's take that and do the other one instead
447675: Okay, time to do the exact opposite
447676: For the lolz, lets do the other one
447677: Whatever you say, I mean, the opposite of what you said
447678: I'm gonna deal out slices like this
447679: I'm thinking slices go out like this
447920: Your opponent gets some points, and YOU'RE paying
447921: Your opponent gets some points, and they come from you
447922: Yeah, your opponent gets some of your hard earned points
447923: The faster meeple wins more
447924: The faster meeple wins more
447925: The faster time is worth more
447926: Everyone else gets points, and YOU'RE paying
447927: Everyone else gets points but they come from you
447928: Everyone else gets to share some of your hard earned points
449533: and since your opponent isn't on one of those slices, you get all the points
449534: and since your opponent is not on a slice next to this one, the points are all yours
449535: You split the pot based on the slices next to this one
449537: How about points for you and the slice adjacent
449538: I see happy meeples coming after this spin
449539: You're gonna share this pot
449540: You and your opponent get to split the pot
449541: You both get a cut
449542: Two players sharing points, How sweet
449543: Ya both get some points this time
449785: With those points, you now qualify to spin the Winner Wheel
449786: With those points, you now qualify to spin the Winner Wheel
449787: With those points, you get to spin the Winner Wheel
449788: With that point total, you can finally spin, the Winner Wheel
449789: With those points, you now have to a chance to spin the Winner Wheel
451382: You have so many points, You are everything your family and friends want you to be
451383: Whoa ho, Look who’s dominating, I-I, I did not expect that
451384: You have more points than a spiky porcupine, Zing
451385: Look at this power player
451386: You have more points than a well formed argument
451387: You have more points than a truck of sharpened pencils, Am I right?
451388: From me to you
451389: This slice is yours
451390: This calls for a slice
451391: A slice it is
451392: Easy easy, I get it -- you know what you’re doing, Let’s play
451393: uh huh… yeah, I was kind of waiting to be interrupted, Let’s get to it
451394: Oh, Oh, you got this, Well never mind, No one likes a wheelsplainer
451395: Oh, no problem, When we get to the hand-to-hand combat round you can just wing it, Good luck
451396: You wanna skip my tutorial? Gosh, I feel a little like a turtle being carried off by a hawk right now, IT’S A METAPHOR
451397: Yeah, Shut up, me, Let’s get to the game
451398: Ah ha, Tutorials’ not your thing, Fair enough, Let’s go
451399: So, You already know how it goes, Enough of my yappin’
451400: I'd like to see the Slice Owner
451401: Slice Owner?
451402: I request the Slice Owner
451403: I want my Slice Owner
451404: Stand by me, Slice Owner
451406: Like they publish books that teach young children about metallurgy, We need more blacksmiths, right?
451407: And then we like invest, but a month later we find out that it's a pyramid scheme? Uh, cool
451408: Generosity, thy name is Wheel
451409: Don't worry, I've got plenty
451410: Giving is SO on my dating profile
451411: This wheel's got deep pockets
451412: Hold them tight, they're very precious
451413: M, Another pair of savory slices
451414: A couple slices to get things going
451415: Two splendid slices for my crew
451416: A couple slices for my meeple crew
451417: It's a slice party and you're invited
451418: We have ourselves a game
451419: Better luck next time, spinner
451420: Never say die meeples
451421: And the game continues
451422: There's more game to play yet
451423: It ain't curtains yet
451424: You others still have a shot
451425: This last question is where the Power Slice is hiding
451426: Question Three and Power Slices are totally a thing
451427: A third question swoops in with the promise of a Power Slice
451428: Question Three is when the Power Slice comes out to play
451429: Let's finish this set strong and get you that Power Slice
451430: Question Three, Oh that's right,The Power Slice Question
451431: Are you stunned by my glorious, enormous presence? Don’t insult your host, just say yes, 
451432: When your ancient forebears invented the wheel, could they have dreamed of something so big, shiny, and full of face, Never, 
451433: Oh, I see you lookin' at my spokes, Yes, they ARE magnificent
451434: Behold my majestic circumference, Witness my deific diameter, Look at my spinny bits
451435: I have lived forever, but I haven’t always been a wheel, In the Dark Ages, I was really into quadrilaterals
451436: Greetings, Oh there's no need to bow, Get up, protect your knees, they're the body's most precious joints
451437: I know I look like a really big wheel, but actually you guys are just extremely small
451438: Bask in my majesty, For I am the big beautiful wheel of legend
451439: Hello, Gaze upon my wheely goodness and tremble with joy, little humans
451440: Hello, I’m an enormous talking wheel, You’re all tiny, little humans, That’s a rock that looks like a crab, Describing things is fun
451441: It’s me, an absolutely enormous wheel, What I lack in corners I make up for in wisdom
451442: What are we thinking? Same question or something different, No judgment here
451443: Gonna stick with the same question or do you have something juicier in mind?
451444: What penetrating question will you ask me this time? The same one or, you know, somethin' fresh?
451445: You got a new question for me? M, I just love that new question smell
451446: Are you pondering the same thing, Or do you got a new spicy-flavored question for me?
451447: You can submit the same question as last time, or try your luck with a new one, Whatever floats your goat
451448: I must break you, is what Ivan Drago from Rocky 4 would say about this tie…
451449: Technically it’s a tie, But uh, only one of you had your heart in it
451450: Completely random ,is how we break ties on THIS mountain
451451: I love Thai food, I hate tie scores
451452: A tie? What? No no
451453: Who has their browser open and doesn’t want tutorials, You, That’s who, Let's play
451454: Guess we don’t need to worry about those pesky tutorials, Let’s begin
451455: No tutorial, Fine by me, I do enough talking as is, Let's roll
451456: The tutorial you're skipping was an elaborate musical number, You're missing out, Game time
451457: Don’t need the tutorial, Oh, great, I had forgotten the rules myself
451458: Much like me when I tried to assemble my AirFryer, no one needs a tutorial here, Time to play
451459: Yeah, I see somebody got cocky and decided to skip the tutorials, We’ll see how that works out for ya, 
451460: No tutorials, But how will you know when to turn on each other, Let the games begin
451461: Looks like it’s no tutorials today for the Too Cool For Tutorials crew, Game time
451462: Meeple, What happened to you? You've got a lot of ground to make up
451463: Don’t worry, little buddy, I’ll take you out for ice cream afterwards, How does that sound?
451464: Ya, Last time I saw someone do this poorly was, uh, uh,  it was, huh, I’ve existed since the beginning of time and I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone do THIS badly
451465: Chin up, I’m sure you’re good at other things, like basket weaving or carpentry
451466: Look at it this way, when it comes to NOT getting points, you are winning by a landslide
451467: You only need a few more points to do better than Bob Saget, who also had a tough run playing this game, Heh, it was ugly
451468: Another one
451469: Take another
451470: One just isn't enough
451471: An extra slice it is
451472: Scoot your little boots up here
451473: Step into my parlor
451474: Step into my office, you're not in trouble
451475: Come up to my room, Mom says we can play Dance Dance Revolution
451476: Time to ascend, Watch out for the hawks up there, They WILL, wreck you
451477: Door down, players up
451478: Let’s make a deal: I’ll answer your big questions if you answer my little ones, You’ll get points on the back end, but I’ll retain all movie rights, Sound good, I can’t shake hands, so just throw something at my face if you agree
451479: I can’t say I’m surprised you’re back, I do see the future so it was kinda predictable
451480: Did you miss me? No need to answer, it’s pretty obvious
451481: My friends are back, Oh, that’s great, because one of you left your charger here the last time, 
451482: This time I’M gonna ask YOU the meaning of life, I'm just kidding, I already know it
451483: My friends are back, Did you have a great summer like I wrote in your yearbook?
451484: You returned, Just like my letters to George Clooney, Why won't you read them George?
451485: Welcome, friends, Welcome back to my magical chocolate factory, Wow, did I really just say that? Okay, Let's go
451486: The Wheel of enormous trolling? More like the Wheel of Enduring Friendships, Welcome back
451487: Either you guys wanna play again or you just can’t figure out how to get off this mountain, Either way, I’m happy
451488: Oh, Time to party, And by party, I mean show off how much arcane knowledge we all know
451489: Back for more, Or is it just that you can’t get the key to the mountaintop bathroom without playing?
451490: I feel so honored that you wanna spend time with me, especially when you’re all having such good hair days
451491: There’s only two things I can’t do: administer medicine to a cat, and say no to another game with you
451492: Being around you folks makes me feel all warm and crispy inside, like a hot loaf of garlic bread
451493: Oh boy, the spin, is about, too?
451494: Yes, yes, oh wait wait, is it
451495: I'm reducing the speed, it's
451496: I'm slowly, slowing down
451497: The anticipation of where I land is killing me
451498: Where will I stop, Even I, don't, know
451499: It's a spin, we'll never, forget
451500: I'm decelerating, and very soon
451501: I'm about to stop, and
451502: This is going to be the spin to tell your grand kids about
451503: I'm revolving, revolving, I'm
451505: Hey, What if THESE TWO started a business together
451506: Woo, Quite a hike to get up here, huh? Now that you got your cardio in
451507: People say living on the top of a mountain is inconvenient, And it is, Slice time
451508: Welcome to the mountaintop, Giant snake-free since 1673
451509: Would it be weird if I had a set of bushes trimmed in your likeness, Asking for a friend
451510: I see you made it up the mountain, That means my bear traps are poorly hidden
451511: Oh, I'm so happy you made it up the mountain, I used to host a game from the Labyrinth of Pain and Despair, this is going much better
451512: What a crazy coincidence, You made it up my mountain alive, and I stopped tossing bricks at people who climb my mountain
451513: It is, the Power Slice
451514: Power Sli-I-I-ice
451515: You're miles in the sky, searching for answers that permeate your soul, But first, you gotta play some trivia, There’s always a catch, right?
451516: Most people search inward to find their truth within, But you're gonna find your truth by answering my trivia questions, That's wild, 
451517: You play my trivia game and I give you the answers to life, the universe and everything? Sounds like a good deal if I say so myself
451518: You wanted your question answered but a gorgeous, ravishing Wheel is talking about trivia, What in the what?
451519: You fell asleep in the dentist chair, and now you're a trivia answering board game meeple? Oh ho ho, I promise it only gets weirder
451520: You expected a buttoned-up host, but boy oh boy does this wheel have some sass
451521: You were on a quest for deep meaning, but now you're like Hey, who is this guy, What did I sign up for?
451522: Did you know that the player with the fewest matches dies, Nah, I’m just kidding, That’s like a totally different game
451523: Putting things together, Like a very quick puzzle
451524: It’s like they say, every coffee has its mate, And every skater, has its skate, And that's great, I’ve been taking a poetry class at night, It's going pretty well
451525: I like to pretend you’re making the matching answers hold hands, And then the answers get old together and they feed bread crumbs to ducks at the park
451526: Look at all my little yentas, making their little matches
451527: The two things you’re pairing go together like wine and cheese, And if I randomly just gave you one of the matches, so be it
451528: Now, you all keep matching, and I’m gonna go see if my lizard eggs have hatched
451530: What if these two started driving around in a van solving mysteries? I just think it’d be fun
451531: Okay go with me, what if these two started a country rock duo, Anyone else seein' this?
451532: What if these two had a staring contest, I think I know who’d win, I mean I do know, I, I  know everything
451533: What if these two have a really elaborate dance routine choreographed and they’re just waiting for the game to end to show it off, Aw, I can’t wait to find out
451534: What if these two rode around everywhere on a tandem bicycle, Huh, Just a thought
451535: What if these two sang a little song, I’d love some impromptu entertainment
451536: Where will you socket your slices?
451537: Some of these slice slots look pretty tempting, right?
451538: Where should your slices go, You tell me, I'm not your mother, But I can shape-shift into your mother if there are any issues you want to work through
451539: That wheel on your browser may look like me, but it's actually my little brother, The Wheel of Tappable Interfaces, 
451540: There's room on my face for all of your slices, I promise
451541: Ooh, Looks like a winner to me
451542: You are lookin' good
451543: You did the best, It's impressive
451544: I see a winner
451545: It's the most impressive meeple
451546: Whoa ho ho
451547: How did you?
451548: How can that be?
451549: Impossible
451550: Really?
451551: No way?
451552: Ugh, why didn’t I put a scoreboard on my back… oh wait, I totally did
451553: I’m like half an Oreo, Except instead of a delicious cream-side, I have your bland-tasting scores
451554: Let’s look at the scores, and rock out to this sort of Russian chip-tune thing I got goin' on
451555: Points don’t really MEAN anything, but let’s just see who has the most, For conversation
451556: You guys wanna see my sick tattoos, Just kidding, It's your sick scores, Ah ooooh
451557: There’s two sides to every wheel, And one of them has your scores
451558: Nobody believes you’re gonna win, That’s what they’re saying behind your back, Except me
451559: Oh I want to keep you in my pocket, If I had pockets, Or pants, If I had pants, you’d be a shoo-in for my pocket
451560: Someone has a secret crush on you and I wanna see it play out
451561: We feel the same way about the movie Titanic and it makes me feel closer to you
451562: I read the question that you asked at the start of the game, And the answer is surprising
451563: I’ve always dreamed of opening a little shop that sells gourmet cupcakes, And then using my laser vision to burn whole cities to the ground, Huh, one day…
451564: Hey, you guys like lounge music? I’m talking Rat Pack stuff, Like Sinahtra Dino? When’s that coming back?
451565: Of all the things that have been offered to me on my altar, nobody has ever sacrificed to me a tuna melt and I'm starting to think it's on purpose
451566: Hey, I know I’m the one with all the answers, but does someone wanna explain to me why calzones and stromboli are two different things, Oh, sorry, I’ll let you focus
451567: Did you know that the plural of moose, is MOOSE? Another GREAT decision from our friends in Canada
451568: Ever wonder where I store all of the slices I give you? All I can say is that the answer is VERY disturbing, Okay, let’s continue
451569: Everyone’s doing just fine, and so am I, thank you for asking, 
451570: Ideally, one of you would be doing really well or really terribly so I could make a joke about it, 
451571: Your score is a state of mind, And an accurate representation of your performance so far
451572: Points, Points for everyone, Except for me, Because, well, I’m beyond points
451573: Don't these two look like they're keeping a secret?
451574: These two look like they have a secret, right?
451575: Spread the double wealth, That's what I always say
451576: Double Dippers, That's a new catch phrase I'm trying out
451577: Equal shares of a doubled pot, Yes please
451578: Two times the points, but spread thin
451579: Double that pot for my peeps
451580: Every round starts with two new slices
451581: The round begins with a pair of slices, Don't worry, they're organic
451582: Before the questions, I give out two slices
451583: Before the trivia, I distribute slices
451584: Every round comes with a pair of slices
451585: When a round begins, I hand out slices
451586: Every round of trivia comes with a cool two slices
451587: Excellent, I love a curious bunch
451588: I have placed your questions on a little shelf in a very windy part of my mountain, They'll be fine, Shall we?
451589: Oh man, I’ve got a GREAT answer for one of these, Hope you win
451590: I’m not sure I’m legally allowed to answer one of these, Well, we’ll see
451591: There are no bad questions, Only vague answers, Now let’s get it done
451592: Great questions, Oh, you humans are so smart with your brains, and your words, and your creepy little hands
451593: These are some peculiar questions, But I am a peculiar wheel
451594: I have collected the questions, They’re in a pile here, You, can’t see them, but they’re there
451595: I'd like to introduce you to Question One
451598: I'd like to start with Question One, How about you?
451599: It's the last spin of the round
451600: I don't know about you but I'm pumped for this last spin
451601: Ooh, Last spin, Let's finish on a high note
451602: Just one last spin, I'm freaking out
451603: There's only one spin left, sniff sniff, I smell burnt cake
451604: Wait, Wa-wa-What’s going on here? … What’s with the names? … Who are all these people getting credit for my one-of-a-kind trivia/wheel-spinning experience?
451605: Ya know I was hoping someone would offer me a German chocolate cake sacrifice, Uh, I think I earned it, I mean, look, when I just phone it in, I don’t expect more than like a poppy seed muffin, But, I put my heart into this one, Okay so it's, ju-just, discouraging
451606: Whoops, Wait-I-I, I just caught a typo in the credits, Uh God, Tha-that's embarrassing, Well, there’s always the patch
451607: You wanna do it again? Eh, come on, I’ll say different stuff this time, you’ll love it
451608: Uh, Thank you, Thank you so much, I'd like to personally thank my mentor, the Square of Infinite Knowledge, my best friends in the entire universe, the Hexagon of Tremendous Magnitude and the Polyhedron of Microscopic Scale, and of course my agents, Paul Kowalski, Rita Reubenstein, Sarah Sphereoid McFadden, Uh, God, You guys are the real heroes, Thank you so much
451609: Well, we're here at the end, And it went by so quickly, didn't it? I mean, That's just life though, You know, you dive into it, you shoot for the big leagues, the real answers, you come up to the mountaintop, and you've just barely arrived and then things get thrown at you left and right, hard questions, softballs, things you've never even heard of, …And suddenly, ya know, bim, bam, bop, Ya know, it's all over, And the one thing you really learned: as smart as you are, as strong as you are, as hard as you work… It all comes down to luck, don't it?  Luck and then you're dead, Huh, WELL,  Have a good one
451610: Life is like a box of chocolates, Someone gives it to you and you’re like, Wha-I-I I didn’t ask for this, But then you have a few and you’re like, Oh, This is pretty good, And then there’s a BUNCH of trivia rounds and you spin a wheel a couple times, someone wins, bing bang boom, everybody dies, no more chocolates
451611: Isn’t it crazy that when this started you were all just a bunch of strangers spending Saturday detention together, and now you’re best friends? Well, even though you’re all so different, Like, like one of you is a jock and, and one of you is mean to everyone else? Oh, Life is so crazy, Anyway, have fun folks, and don’t… you… forget about me
451612: Here’s a little fact about me, One time I took a bath, So, it, it was a big bath because I’m a big wheel, and I got stuck, and the bottom part of me rusted, But yeah, here’s the thing, When it was over, I felt relaxed, So I, I get what they say, you know, about baths, They’re, they're nice
451613: Sometimes when people spin me just a little bit, I feel ticklish, But who’s gonna tickle me? Ya know I mean, you can’t tickle a god, Yea, anyway, what are you all doing after this? Going to get like a pizza or something? I could go for a Greek salad but, Oh shoot, I-I gotta move to a different spot or I’m gonna get towed
451614: You know when you look up in the sky and there’s a rainbow? That’s because someone just received a beautiful answer on my mountaintop, Actually, the same is true of devastating hailstorms, I don’t know why sometimes it’s one and sometimes it’s the other
451615: Not to complain, but my gears definitely need lubricating, Someone - I’m not gonna say who - spun me a bit aggressively and uh, Ugh, I just felt a little something in there, ya know? Once you get past 5000 years old, you notice these things
451616: Well, I hope you enjoyed my Divine Wisdom experience, You may not know this but I'm also a dope surfing instructor, So if you ever wanna learn to hang ten and be a cool surfer dude, I'm right here, yo
451617: Well, I hope you enjoyed my Divine Wisdom experience, On your way down the mountain you may see a small goblin with a goatee, That's Charles, Uh, Don't look him in the eyes, but also you-you shouldn't look away either, You know what? Maybe it would just be safer if you stayed up here forever instead?
451618: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to hover in the background here and silently rank my favorite New York slam poets, You know, I was a big Mahogany L, Browne fan before it was cool
451619: It's a split pot
451620: You get to split the pot
451621: Its fun to share points
451623: You share the pot and my excitement
451624: Multiple winners get to be happy
451625: It's a pot share
451626: The sequel to Question One? Question Two
451627: Question Two incoming
451628: Acquaint yourself with Question Two
451629: Imagine a second question, let's call it Question Two
451630: Question Two? Don't mind if I do
451631: Question Two kinda sneaks up on you, right?
451632: Look at these freakin' scores
451633: These scores are out of control
451634: You're making your parents proud with those scores
451635: You did something special just now
451636: You must be drinking brain juice with scores like that
451637: Those scores are for the ages
451638: How can you be smart like that?
451639: I see two wisdom warriors
451640: Ooh, Two of you little ones are on fire, 
451641: Are you two for real right now?
451642: You two are a sight to behold
451643: It's the gruesome two-some, Your scores are nasty
451644: You two are making me take notice
451645: Two of you are something else
451646: A meeple becomes a king
451647: You did better than I thought possible
451648: That score is hard to believe
451649: Oh, Your score makes me smile so wide it hurts a little
451650: You're killing me with that score
451651: Your score is sweeter than a watermelon
451652: Oh, And then there's the moyai
451653: But what about the moyai, right?
451655: Ya know, I used to wear hats but every time I got spun they would fly right off, They all ended up in that valley called The Valley of Hats
451656: I just want to say I love human beings, Through all trials you persevere, you're smart, delicious, and innovative, I admire you
451657: Not what you expected, was it? What can I say, life's unpredictable
451658: Okay, I gotta know, Was it everything you hoped for? Nah, never mind, let’s not kill the mood
451659: I have revealed the truth, Now get off of my mountain, My shows are on
451660: This is a big day for you, I can tell, Enjoy your wisdom
451662: The Wheel has spoken
451663: The Wheel has spoken
451664: The Wheel has spoken
451665: I love this result
451666: Hey hey
451667: M, I like what I see
451668: What a great spin
451669: Rama-lama ding dong
451670: Oh yeah
451671: Hello
451672: Your friends are neck and neck, Oh, to have a friend, Or a neck
451673: Whoa, those are some close scores, Spread out
451674: You and your scores are so similar, There's nothing quite like the exhilarating possibility of a, tie game
451675: Why are your scores so similar, Have you been sharing answers, you little sneaks?
451676: This one is a close game, And here I was hoping for uninteresting blowout
451677: Some of you have more points than others, Hey, with incisive commentary like that, I could be a professional sportscaster
451678: Who will win, Who will lose, Who will leave to go get more snacks and never return, All remains to be seen
451679: Round one is behind us, and already it feels like we’re all a little older, A little wiser, A little, dare I say, more mature
451680: Here are your scores, Now show me YOUR backs, What secrets ya got back there?
451681: Here are your scores, also, I think I got a weird mole back there, do you guys see anything?
451682: I'm having such deja vu, I swear you've been here before with these exact scores, And now, one of you will randomly turn into a duck, and start knitting, Okay, it was probably a dream
451683: When I say score, you say board, Score, Score, okay it's a bit cringey and I'll stop
451684: I've gone ahead and stack ranked your scores because I like stacking things, Is that a crime? Nobody else likes to stack things? Come on
451685: You’re all so focused right now, Did you even notice that I’m wearing a funky mustache, Aw forget it, mustache is gone, you missed it
451686: Like when I was trying to decide which of my triplet siblings to eat in the womb, it’s either one or the other
451687: Deciding is so difficult, Don't you just hate it when you have a difficult decision to make and someone's just jibber-jabbering in your ear, Oh, my, Wheel, I hate that
451688: If your score gets high enough, I send you a free pizza, How high does your score need to be, I'll never tell
451689: Wait, what if, whenever you get a high score, I make you grow an extra leg, Because I can totally make that happen if you're into it
451690: Are you doing a Travolta - Nick Cage face swap thing like in the movie Face Off? You can't fool me
451691: I am an all knowing wheel, I know when two people are in cahoots
451692: I see sparks flying between the two of you, Sparks of hatred
451693: I expected trouble from the others, but not you two
451694: Ya know, I thought I saw some lemurs steal my bagel this morning, but now I'm thinking maybe it was you
451695: You just doubled up
451696: You hit the jackpot
451697: Two times the riches
451698: Double that pot, That's what you get
451699: and then there's you
451700: and no, I didn't forget
451701: Since you did the VERY best
451702: And if you're on top
452514: Names and numbers, right, Good stuff, Okay, let's proceed
452515: Do you think this is my best side, Uh, ya know what, I don't even want to know, Let's move on
452516: You're not doing well, Um, Do uh, Do you believe in the power of prayer?
452517: There is hope for you, little one, Yes, even you
452518: And now you are enlightened, Oh, don’t worry, It takes a few minutes to sink in
452519: Not to get all personal, but uh, I feel a bit naked without your slice on my face
452520: Now that you’re here, please gently adorn my face with your slice
452521: Oh, I’m overdue for a make over, Could you apply some slice foundation? Be generous
452522: It's a squeaker, Oh, I love saying squeaker
452523: I can't stand the suspense of a game this close, but I'm already suspended
452524: Look at these scores in a tight cluster, Such an easy target for eagles to drop turds on
452525: True story, I wanted to call this a DisorDat question, but apparently a game developer in Chicago has it trademarked, I inquired about it, they never got back to me, Huh, Chicago ans, That isn't even what pizza looks like
452526: I don’t see how these questions will serve you in life, But who am I to judge?
452527: Oh-- well, don’t mind me, I’m just an immortal deity who TALKS TOO MUCH, Fine
452528: I just find you adorable, Ya know, the heart wants what it wants
452623: I, The Wheel, have spoken
452624: The Wheel of enormous trolling has spoken
452625: Let it be known, The Wheel has spoken
452626: Huzzah, The Wheel has spoken
452627: Let the people cry out, Hosanna, The Wheel has spoken
454698: You need at least 100,000 points to win
454702: Tap an item in column A, then tap its match in column B
454703: Tap an item in column A, then tap its match in column B
454777: Legend has it that this host loves to do a little trolling
454779: Will you survive the chaos, or will you rage quit like you lost a call of duty game?
454780: We're gonna assign you to a new question now, and hopefully you win and get to learn something real important
454781: We're gonna assign you to a new question now, and hopefully you win and get to learn something real important
454782: Everyone gets a new question and a chance to win and share the answer
454783: You all get a new question and maybe this time you'll be the one to win and share the answer with the world
454784: Enjoy your new question, If you win you'll get to share the answer with strangers you pass on the street
454785: Here, have a new question, It's all yours, And maybe you'll win this time, and we can get to the bottom of it?
454786: A new game means a new question for each of you, If you win this time you'll have an answer AND your old volleyball coach will be so proud of you
454787: Here's a brand new question for ya, Ooh, I want one of you to win the most so that I can reveal the shocking answer
454788: Meet me on the mountaintop
454789: Meet me, on the mountaintop
454790: Now get over here, you
454791: Now get over here
454877: If you do not submit a question, one will be provided for you
454878: If you can't think of a question, a random one will be assigned to you
454879: If you can't think of a question don't worry, I'll grab you one from my fan mail
454880: If you can't come up with a good question we'll get you something random, Better than nothin', right?
454881: There's no shame if you're drawing a blank here, I'll just cook up a random question for you
455156: Uh, please hurry, This opportunity is ending soon
455157: Please hurry, This opportunity is ending soon
455158: Hurry please, Surely a deep question has brought you here today
455159: Your time is nearly up, Enter your question and tap submit
455160: Don't dawdle, Your time is almost up
458173: It's a slice party and you're invited
458174: When a round begins, I hand out slices
458175: Before the trivia I distribute slices
458176: The slices shall be distributed as follows
458177: The slices shall be distributed as follows
458178: I'm gonna deal out slices like this
458179: I'm thinking slices go out like this
458180: When a round begins, I hand out slices
458181: Before the trivia I distribute slices
462168: and your life, forever changed
462169: Go on, Choose a slice that has a lot of one players slices running through it
462170: Go on, Choose a slice that has a lot of one players slices running through it
462172: Here we go, The player who just blindly put their slices next to each other totally had it coming
462173: Let's see how cut throat you are, A string of slices are yours to mess with
462174: Do you want me to give points to the player with the MOST slices or the FEWEST slices?
462175: Do you want me to give points to the player with the MOST slices or the FEWEST slices?
462176: Do you want me to give points to the player with the MOST slices showing on my face or the FEWEST slices?
462177: Do you want me to give points to the player with the MOST slices on my face or the FEWEST slices on my face?
462182: Hurry up now, If you can't find a good set, you can always just pick a slice at random
462183: Yeah, hurry up now, If you can't find a good set, you can always just pick a slice at random
462185: Come on, The slices that were put next to each other are calling out to you
462190: We don't need a bonus effect, 'cause you're spinning the Winner Wheel
462191: We don't need a bonus effect, 'cause, you're spinning the Winner Wheel
462192: Let's skip the extra stuff, you're spinning the Winner Wheel
462193: Forget about the other stuff, it's Winner Wheel time
462194: Set the bonus aside, 'cause you've got a Winner Wheel to spin
462195: Who needs the bonus, You're ready for the Winner Wheel
462196: I don't even care what that slice was, 'cause you're spinning the Winner Wheel
462197: Bonus effect be darned, you have a Winner Wheel to spin
462198: Choose a slice, You will steal a set of linked slices that belong to another player
462199: Choose a slice, You'll steal a set of slices that belong to another player
462200: Choose a slice, You'll steal a set of slices that are touching and belong to another player
462363: Go on other meeples, if you all vote for the same player, I'll give them the points instead
462364: Vote now little ones, if you can all vote for the same player, I'll give them the points instead
462365: Now's your chance to vote, if you all pick the same player, I'll give them the points instead
462366: I'm gonna give you the pot again, unless the others can unite around someone else
462367: You're gonna win the pot again, unless the others agree to give it to someone else
462368: You're about to get the pot again, but the other meeples can agree on someone else
462369: If you pick one that no one else does, you win the pot again
462370: Pick one that no one else picks and you win the pot again
462371: If you pick a slice no one else picks, then you win the pot again
462453: Earn 100,000 points and you'll be able to spin the Winner Wheel
462454: To start things off
462455: Question one? Works for me
462456: I'm in the mood for Question One
462457: Is that Question One? Yeah it is
462458: We will start with Question One
462731: Grinding, to, a halt
462732: Ooh, oh, oh
462887: I like what you've done here
462888: I'm a fan of your work, little one
462889: You've made an excellent choice
462890: There's a certain Feng Shuay to your decision, I like it
462891: Oh, what a fine slice decision, Very good
462892: Ooh, I can't wait to see where you choose
462893: There are no bad moves here, But if there was I wouldn't tell you because I believe in fair play
462894: Go ahead, Choose any slice your heart desires
462895: Will you take over a crowded slice, Or maybe snatch one from your rival?
462896: You've got an exciting decision to make, and everyone else is very jealous
462897: Choose a slice and it will become all yours
462898: Choose any slice and it will become all yours
462899: Choose a slice to make it all your own
462900: Choose a slice and it will be all yours
462901: Hurry up or you get nothing
462902: Hurry up or, you get nothing
462903: Let's go or you'll miss out on a free slice
462904: Uh, I need a choice or that free slice goes bye-bye
462949: The power slice multiplies until someone lands on it
462950: The power slice, it grows in number, until you land on one
462951: The thing about power slices, they clone themselves until you land on one
462952: Power slices reproduce until you land on one, how about that?
463369: Should I skull up the single player slices, or the shared slices
463371: Should player slices be worth more, or should I just mix them all up instead
